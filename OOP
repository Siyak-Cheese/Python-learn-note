**** Tutorial 1: Classes and Instances ****
> class Example:
> __init__(self,)
    # Initializes the parameters and instances of the class.
    # self is instance equal to variable.
    # var_1 = Example()
    # var_1 is self.
> def method(self):
    # self is instance of method.
> Example.method(self=variable)
    # assgin variable as self(instance)
    # let calss method know what does instance.
> exma_1.method()
    # exma_1 = self in method.

**** Tutorial 2: Classes Variables ****
> Share class variable in all instances of class.
> __dict__: namespace
> self.
> class.

**** Tutorial 3: classmethods and staticmethods ****
> @classmethod
> @staticmethod
